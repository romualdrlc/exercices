# Hello teachers !

## Context and objectives

For the first exercise of the day, you want to say hello to the teachers (with `forEach`, for instance). 

It's like a "Hello World !" function but way fancier. ðŸ˜Ž

## Specs

In the `src/say-hello-to-teachers.js`, write a function `sayHelloToTeachers ` that takes an array of teacher's names as an argument, and prints for each "Hello <teacherName>!"

E.g.

```javascript

sayHelloToTeachers(teachers)
/*
Hello ClÃ©ment !
Hello Nicolas!
...
*/

```

You can see what your function does by running

```bash
yarn start
```

and run the tests with 

```bash
yarn test
```
