# Playing with Variable Definitions

## Context and Objectives

Variables and constants are the main building blocks of any application.
You will have to create, assign and reassign a whole lot of them so it's better to start quickly.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, on your terminal go to the folder `src` file in folder `01_play_with_variables` and execute the exercice with `node ./01_play_with_variables.js`

Let's create different constants:

- a constant called `question`, binded to a string: "Spartan, what is your profession?!";
- a constant called `answer`, binded to an integer: "Dev dev dev!";
- a constant called `foo`, binded to an integer: 12;
- a constant called `bar`, binded to an integer: 28;
- a constant called `sumResult`, binded to the sum of `foo` and `bar`;
- a constant called `prodResult`, binded to the product of `bar` and `foo`.
- a constant called `sparta`, binded to an object with a field `check`, with the value of `question` and with the field `response`, with the value of `answer`;
- a constant called `leader`, binded to the value of the field `check` of the object `sparta`;
- a constant called `digits`, binded to an array from zero to nine.
