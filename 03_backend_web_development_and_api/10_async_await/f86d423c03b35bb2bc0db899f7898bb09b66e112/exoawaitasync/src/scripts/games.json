    "summary": "A NES game based on the famed Paris-Dakar Rally, developed by ISCO. While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level. \n \nParis-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing. \n \nDeveloped by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary \"kusoge\" (crap game). \n \nStage 1 - Preparation \nIn the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally. \n \nStage 2 - First Day \nThe first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage. \n \nStage 3 - Second Day \nThis mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them. \n \nStage 4 - Third Day \nThe action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue. \n \nStage 5 - Fourth Day \nAs the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks. \n \nStage 6 - Fifth Day \nInto the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts. \n \nStage 7 - Sixth Day \nAt some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line. \n \nStage 8 - Final Day \nThe Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.",

Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect. \n \nWeapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.",

The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. \n \nJigsaw Sudoku: \n \nThe rules of Jigsaw Sudoku are similar to standard Sudoku since you must place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to whatever the size of the puzzle is) into each of the rows and columns. However, whereas standard Sudoku also has rectangular boxes that must each contain every number, in Jigsaw Sudoku these boxes are replaced by different bold-lined shapes that must each contain every number instead. © \n \nKiller Sudoku: \n \nKiller Sudoku puzzles include all the rules of regular Sudoku but add in dashed-line 'cages' which must sum to given values. Killer Sudoku is also sometimes known as Sumdoku, Mathdoku or Addoku. The name 'Killer' Sudoku arises because of the wicked twist on the standard Sudoku puzzle, since you must not only place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to the size of the puzzle) into each of the rows, columns, and bold-lined 3x3 (or other sizes) boxes but you must also place the numbers into each dashed-line cage so that they add up to its given total - and without repeating a digit in a dashed-line cage.",

A full sequel was released in 1993 (Alien Breed 2) and a 3D edition, which won a number of technical achievement awards in 1994. The well-loved series has lain dormant for 14 years, until now, arriving in stunning fashion with the production-heavy 'Alien Breed Evolution'.",

Will your prison disregard human rights, impose intentional harshness and be devoid of any notions of wellbeing and freedom? The choice is yours. \n\nIn Prison Architect you will see the impact of your grand design on the lives of your inmates; be it a utopic center for rehabilitation, a brutal Super Max Prison or anything in between. Even when all of your prisoners’ needs are met, remember one thing - it’s still a prison and no one really wants to be there.\n\nStart your journey into the world of Prison Architect by playing through the Prison Stories (campaign). Here you’ll learn the ropes by being brought in to equip a small prison with everything it needs to perform its first execution, all before being called up to deal with emergencies at larger and larger prisons. You’ll quickly learn how to cope with blazing infernos, hostage situations and prison wide riots - if you make it through all that unscathed, the Mayor will be ready to give you the reigns of a brand new prison development where you can build the prison of your dreams.\n\nBuild and Manage A Maximum Security Prison\n\nOnce you are ready to begin building your own prison, in Architect Mode (sandbox) you can either choose to take control of one of several pre-built prisons right away or build one entirely from scratch.\n\nActing as both architect and governor, you control every detail of your Prison - from building new cells and facilities to hiring staff and creating reform programs - all while dealing with informants, contraband smuggling, gang warfare, full scale riots and more!\n\nOnce your prison is built, go online with World of Wardens to share your designs with the community. You can also browse and play other Architects’ prisons from around the world!",
