# Subtotal

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

Create a function that takes a _cart_ as an input (meaning an array of items with their `product`, `quantity` and `price`)
and return the same data with an additional `subtotal` key that is the result of `quantity` times `price`.

## SPECS

Export the function `calculateSubtotal` in the `src/subtotal.ts`.

Remember that prices are in cents, to avoid rounding errors.
