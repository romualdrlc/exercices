# Search Form

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

We don't always know the full title of a game so let's make a search form.

## SPECS

You can run `yarn populate-db` to reset your database (and remove the previously added comments).

Add a search form in the project and create a new route `/search` that will display the games that contain the search in their name.
