# Basic component

## Context and objectives

You have had to do this exercise, now you will test it yourselves

## Specs

Using [`taiko`](https://taiko.dev), you should add tests that check that the button really hides things.

Your test(s) should:

- check that when launching the page, the paragraph "This is my text" is present
- click on the "Hide content" button
- check that the paragraph is no longer there
- click again on the button
- check that the paragraph is there again
